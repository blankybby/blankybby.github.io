# BLANKYBBY
Welcome to the README!!!<br><br> Do you really need to read this? No, not really :P

# Site Deetz
This space here is to help give some details about me while viewing the repo, but also wanted to share a bit about the site first.<br><br>The style is intentional. While not super professional by today's standards, I like the old school look. Crisp lines and eye seering color for that extra WOW factor.<br><br>The pages herein are both as a practice place for static web and also to help highligh whats goin on.<br>
